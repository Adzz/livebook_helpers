# Mix.Tasks.Archive

Lists all installed archives.

Archives are typically installed at `~/.mix/archives`
although the installation path can be customized by
setting the `MIX_ARCHIVES` environment variable.

Since archives are specific to Elixir versions, it is
expected from build tools to swap the `MIX_ARCHIVES`
variable to different locations based on a particular
Elixir installation.
