# List.Chars

The `List.Chars` protocol is responsible for
converting a structure to a charlist (only if applicable).

The only function that must be implemented is
`to_charlist/1` which does the conversion.

The `to_charlist/1` function automatically imported
by `Kernel` invokes this protocol.

## Function to_charlist/1

Converts `term` to a charlist.

## to_charlist/1

Converts `term` to a charlist.
