# Date.Range

## Section

Returns an inclusive range between dates.

Ranges must be created with the `Date.range/2` or `Date.range/3` function.

The following fields are public:

* `:first` - the initial date on the range
* `:last` - the last date on the range
* `:step` - (since v1.12.0) the step

The remaining fields are private and should not be accessed.
