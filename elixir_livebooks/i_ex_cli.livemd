# IEx.CLI

## Function start/0

In order to work properly, IEx needs to be set as the
proper `-user` when starting the Erlang VM and we do so
by pointing exactly to this function.

If possible, Elixir will start a tty (smart terminal)
which makes all control commands available in tty
available to the developer.

In case `tty` is not available (for example, Windows),
a dumb terminal version is started instead.
