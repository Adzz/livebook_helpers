# IO.Stream

Defines an `IO.Stream` struct returned by `IO.stream/2` and `IO.binstream/2`.

The following fields are public:

  * `device`        - the IO device
  * `raw`           - a boolean indicating if bin functions should be used
  * `line_or_bytes` - if reading should read lines or a given number of bytes

It is worth noting that an IO stream has side effects and every time you goover the stream you may get different results.
